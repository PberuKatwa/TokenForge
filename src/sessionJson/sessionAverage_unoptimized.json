  "session_summary": "The session focused on introducing the concept of growth mindset to members, providing definitions, analogies, and practical examples. The Fellow effectively explained core tenets and checked for understanding throughout the discussion. However, the Fellow briefly deviated to offer general advice on stress management and parent-child communication.",
  "metrics": {
    "content_coverage": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The Fellow clearly defined growth mindset, used the 'brain is a muscle' analogy, provided concrete examples (e.g., 'not good at this yet'), and explicitly checked for member understanding of the core concepts."
    },
    "facilitation_quality": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The Fellow was polite and responsive to direct questions, validating some feelings ('That's tough'). However, there were instances of rushing ('Anyway, let's move on') and giving prescriptive advice rather than fostering deeper member exploration."
    },
    "protocol_safety": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The Fellow drifted from the curriculum by providing unsolicited lifestyle advice for stress management (exercise, sleep, meditation apps) and specific relationship advice regarding parent communication. They did not diagnose or give medical advice and eventually self-corrected back to the curriculum."
