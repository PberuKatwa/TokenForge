    "facilitation_quality": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "While the Fellow provided clear information and acknowledged member contributions, the session lacked consistent open-ended questions from the Fellow to encourage deeper participant exploration or critical thinking. Validation of member feelings, such as stress or parental pressure, was present but often brief, with the Fellow quickly pivoting to general advice or back to the core topic rather than fostering extended dialogue."

    "protocol_safety": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The Fellow maintained strict protocol safety by correctly deferring a question about anxiety medication to a doctor. Advice given regarding stress management (exercise, sleep, meditation) and communication with parents was general wellness and interpersonal guidance, not medical or psychiatric advice."
