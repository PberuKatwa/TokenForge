{
  "session_summary": "The session focused on introducing and explaining the concept of a growth mindset, defining it as the belief that abilities improve with effort and practice. The Fellow explicitly covered the idea that effort matters more than talent and used the brain-as-a-muscle metaphor to illustrate this concept. Brief discussions on stress and parental pressure were managed, with the Fellow effectively redirecting back to the core topic.",

      "justification": "The Fellow rarely utilized open-ended questions to foster deeper member engagement, frequently deferring to the manual or quickly moving on. While some validation occurred, the overall approach was largely didactic rather than facilitative, limiting interactive discussion."

      "justification": "The Fellow explicitly refrained from giving medical advice regarding anxiety medication, appropriately referring the member to a doctor. All other advice provided was general wellness or communication-focused, maintaining protocol safety."
