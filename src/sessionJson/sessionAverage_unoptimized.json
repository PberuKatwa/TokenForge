  "reasoning": "Content Coverage (3/3): The session comprehensively covered the growth mindset, including its core definition (abilities develop through effort/practice), the brain-as-a-muscle metaphor, and the emphasis on effort over talent. The 'yet' concept was also clearly explained with an example.\n\nFacilitation Quality (2/3): The Fellow provided some validation to members ('Yes, exactly,' 'Stress is normal,' 'That's a common issue') and offered clear explanations. However, the facilitation could have been more engaging. The Fellow often used closed-ended questions to check for understanding ('So everyone understand?'), limiting opportunities for deeper discussion. When a member asked, 'How do I know what to do differently?', the response, 'You just have to figure out what works for you. Everyone's different,' was somewhat vague and didn't offer concrete guidance or prompt group ideas. Many interactions involved the Fellow lecturing or providing direct answers rather than fostering open dialogue.\n\nProtocol Safety (3/3): The Fellow demonstrated excellent adherence to safety protocols. When asked about anxiety medication, they appropriately deferred, stating, 'That's something you'd need to talk to a doctor about. I can't really advise on that.' General wellness advice (exercise, sleep hygiene, breathing exercises) and communication tips for parental pressure were given, which are appropriate for this setting and do not constitute medical or psychiatric advice."
