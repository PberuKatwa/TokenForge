  "session_summary": "The session introduced the concept of growth mindset, defining it as the belief that abilities can be developed through effort and practice. Key components like the brain's muscle-like capacity for change and the importance of effort over natural talent were explained and reinforced. The Fellow also provided practical advice for applying a growth mindset, navigating member questions, and appropriately referring out for medical advice while largely staying on topic.",

      "justification": "The session clearly covered the definition of growth mindset, emphasized effort over talent multiple times (e.g., 'effort matters more than talent'), and introduced the brain's 'muscle' metaphor effectively ('It's kind of like a muscle in that way')."

      "justification": "The Fellow provided some validation ('Okay, that's tough,' 'Yes, good question') but primarily used closed-ended questions ('So everyone understand?', 'Any questions?') and sometimes redirected or provided direct advice rather than facilitating deeper exploration of member concerns (e.g., 'Anyway, we should probably get back to growth mindset')."

      "justification": "The Fellow explicitly refrained from giving medical advice regarding anxiety medication, appropriately directing the member to 'talk to a doctor about it' and stating 'I can't really advise on that,' ensuring protocol safety."
