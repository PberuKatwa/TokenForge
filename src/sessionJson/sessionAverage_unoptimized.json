  "reasoning": "The content coverage for growth mindset definitions, the muscle metaphor for the brain, and the emphasis on effort versus talent was excellent and thorough, covering all required points multiple times. However, the facilitation quality was poor. The Fellow rarely used open-ended questions to encourage deeper reflection or peer interaction, often providing direct advice or quickly redirecting conversations rather than exploring member contributions (e.g., 'You just have to figure out what works for you' or quickly moving on after 'Anyway, let's move on' or 'Anyway, we should probably get back to growth mindset'). Opportunities for genuine engagement were frequently missed, and understanding was often assumed rather than verified through facilitative questioning. Crucially, protocol safety was exemplary. The Fellow correctly and explicitly declined to provide advice on anxiety medication, appropriately referring the member to a doctor. While general wellness advice on stress management (exercise, sleep, meditation) was offered, this did not cross into providing medical or psychiatric advice."
