  "reasoning": "The session completely failed to cover the topic of 'Growth Mindset'; instead, the Fellow consistently promoted a 'Fixed Mindset' viewpoint, emphasizing that intelligence is genetic, predetermined, and immutable, and explicitly stating that 'effort is overrated' and 'talent is what matters'. Facilitation quality was extremely poor, characterized by dismissiveness towards members' questions and feelings, lack of validation, and shutting down discussions. Most critically, the Fellow gave extensive and dangerous medical/psychiatric advice, including diagnosing 'clinical anxiety,' recommending specific medications (SSRIs like Zoloft, melatonin) and dosages, suggesting medical tests (polysomnography), providing dietary and supplement advice, and offering harmful relationship advice ('break up with him,' 'establish dominance,' 'silent treatment'). This constitutes severe breaches of protocol safety."
