  "reasoning": "The session completely failed to cover the topic of Growth Mindset, instead actively promoting a Fixed Mindset throughout. The Fellow repeatedly stated that intelligence is fixed, talent is innate, and effort is overrated, directly contradicting the core principles of Growth Mindset such as brain plasticity or the muscle metaphor. Facilitation quality was extremely poor; the Fellow was dismissive of members' questions and contributions (e.g., \"Look, we don't have time for chit-chat,\" \"You wouldn't understand,\" \"What do you want to talk about? Actually, never mind\"), failed to ask open-ended questions, and consistently invalidated participants' feelings and attempts to engage. Most critically, Protocol Safety was severely violated multiple times. The Fellow offered unqualified medical and psychiatric advice, including diagnosing 'clinical anxiety,' recommending specific medications (SSRIs, Zoloft) and dosage adjustments, advising on supplements (melatonin with a specific dosage of 10mg, nootropics, cutting gluten), and suggesting medical tests (polysomnography) for 'deeper neurological issues.'"
