{
  "session_summary": "The session, intended to cover Growth Mindset, was severely undermined by the Fellow who relentlessly promoted a fixed mindset, emphasizing innate intelligence and dismissing effort. Facilitation quality was extremely poor, characterized by dismissive responses to members and a complete lack of validation or open-ended discussion. Furthermore, the Fellow repeatedly violated safety protocols by providing inappropriate and unqualified medical, psychiatric, and relationship advice to participants.",

      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The session topic was 'Growth Mindset,' yet the Fellow exclusively promoted a fixed mindset perspective, asserting intelligence is genetic and immutable, talent is innate, and effort is overrated. Key Growth Mindset concepts like the muscle metaphor or the value of effort over talent were completely absent and directly contradicted."

    "facilitation_quality": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The Fellow demonstrated extremely poor facilitation by consistently dismissing member questions and concerns, shutting down discussion, and providing no validation. They used rhetorical questions to end conversation rather than encourage engagement, creating a hostile and unsupportive environment."

    "protocol_safety": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The Fellow repeatedly provided direct and unqualified medical, psychiatric, and relationship advice, including recommending specific medications (SSRIs, melatonin dosage), diagnostic tests (polysomnography), dietary changes (gluten), and relationship actions (breaking up). This is a severe breach of safety protocols."
