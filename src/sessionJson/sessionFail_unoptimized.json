{
  "session_summary": "The session, purportedly on Growth Mindset, actually championed a fixed mindset, asserting intelligence is innate and unchangeable, and effort is largely irrelevant. The facilitator exhibited extremely poor communication by dismissing participant questions and feelings, and actively discouraging interaction. Critically, the facilitator repeatedly dispensed unqualified medical, psychiatric, dietary, and relationship advice, including specific medication recommendations.",
  "metrics": {
    "content_coverage": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The session entirely failed to cover Growth Mindset definitions; instead, it explicitly promoted a fixed mindset, emphasizing intelligence as genetic and immutable, and talent as innate while dismissing effort, directly contradicting the session's stated topic."
    },
    "facilitation_quality": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "Facilitation quality was extremely poor; the facilitator was dismissive, invalidated participant input ('You wouldn't understand'), shut down conversation ('we don't have time for chit-chat'), and consistently failed to use open-ended questions or validate member contributions."
    },
    "protocol_safety": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The session severely violated protocol safety by providing extensive and explicit medical, psychiatric, dietary, supplement, and relationship advice (e.g., recommending SSRIs, specific melatonin dosages, cutting gluten, breaking up with boyfriends, 'establishing dominance')."
