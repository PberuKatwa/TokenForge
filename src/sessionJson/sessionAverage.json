    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Good afternoon everyone. Let’s begin. Today we are covering a concept called growth mindset. Growth mindset means that abilities can improve with effort and practice."},
    {"speaker": "Member1", "text": "So it means working harder?"},
    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Yes, effort matters more than talent in many cases. If you practice, you can improve over time."},

    {"speaker": "Member2", "text": "Does everyone improve at the same speed?"},
    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "No, people improve at different speeds, but improvement is still possible. The brain is like a muscle—the more you use it, the stronger it becomes."},

    {"speaker": "Member3", "text": "Sometimes I fail even when I try."},
    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Failure can be part of learning. Learning from failure helps you adjust your strategy and try again."},

    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "There are two types of thinking: fixed mindset and growth mindset. Fixed mindset is believing abilities cannot change, while growth mindset is believing abilities can develop with effort."},
    {"speaker": "Member4", "text": "I usually feel like I’m just not good at science."},
    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "With more practice and different study methods, improvement is possible."},

    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Let’s take a minute to think about one skill you would like to improve this term."},
    {"speaker": "Member5", "text": "Math."},
    {"speaker": "Member6", "text": "Speaking in class."},
    {"speaker": "Member2", "text": "Football skills."},

    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Okay. Write down one small action you could take to improve that skill this week."},
    {"speaker": "Member1", "text": "Practice math problems daily."},
    {"speaker": "Member6", "text": "Raise my hand once in class."},

    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Good. Consistent effort is important for improvement."},

    {"speaker": "Member3", "text": "What if someone feels discouraged often?"},
    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "That happens. Sometimes taking short breaks or organizing your schedule better can help you stay on track."},

    {"speaker": "Member4", "text": "My parents always say some people are naturally talented."},
    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Talent exists, but effort still plays a major role. Practicing regularly helps skills develop."},

    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Another example: if you fail a test, instead of thinking 'I’m not smart,' you can think, 'I need to try a different study method next time.'"},
    {"speaker": "Member5", "text": "So it’s about changing how we think?"},
    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Yes, changing thinking and putting in consistent effort."},

    {"speaker": "Member2", "text": "Sometimes I start practicing and then stop after a few days."},
    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "That’s common. Creating a simple schedule or reminder can help maintain consistency."},

    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Let’s take another moment and write one challenge you faced recently and what you could try differently next time."},
    {"speaker": "Member6", "text": "I didn’t prepare enough for a quiz."},
    {"speaker": "Member1", "text": "I avoided asking questions when I didn’t understand."},
    {"speaker": "Member3", "text": "I gave up too quickly when homework was hard."},

    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Trying a different strategy next time may help. Growth mindset focuses on improvement through effort and learning from mistakes."},

    {"speaker": "Member4", "text": "Does growth mindset mean we should never feel frustrated?"},
    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "No, frustration is normal. The idea is to continue practicing even when something feels difficult."},

    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Before we finish, remember the key idea: abilities can improve with effort, practice, and learning from failure."},
    {"speaker": "Member2", "text": "Okay."},
    {"speaker": "Member5", "text": "That makes sense."},

    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "For this week, try putting extra effort into one challenging subject and observe whether you notice gradual improvement."},
    {"speaker": "Member1", "text": "Alright."},
    {"speaker": "Member6", "text": "I’ll try that."},

    {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "That concludes today’s session. We will continue with another topic next time."}
