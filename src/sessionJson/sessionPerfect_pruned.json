      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Thank you for sharing. I appreciate the honesty. It sounds like some of you have had long days. Today we're talking about something that can really help during stressful times—growth mindset."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. It means effort matters more than talent. Instead of thinking 'I'm just not smart,' we think 'I can improve with practice.' What do you think that means in real life?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Yes, that's a great example. Studying differently or putting in more effort can help you improve."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's a common thought, and I'm glad you brought it up. People may start at different levels, but research shows the brain is like a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it becomes. What happens to a muscle if you train it consistently?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like that was really disappointing. In a growth mindset, failure isn't proof that you can't do it—it's information. It shows you that you may need a new strategy. What could be a different approach next time?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's a perfect example of growth mindset in action. You practiced, and your ability developed. How did it feel when you noticed yourself improving?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That confidence you built came from effort and practice. That's the power of growth mindset."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Yes, consistent effort builds skill over time. Thank you for sharing that example."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Let's compare two thoughts. Fixed mindset says: 'I'm bad at science.' Growth mindset says: 'I'm not good at science yet, but I can improve.' What differences do you notice between these two statements?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "I like how you put that—hopeful. That word is powerful. The word 'yet' is especially important because it acknowledges where you are now while leaving room for growth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's an important question. Sometimes we need to try different strategies, not just more effort. It's like if you're trying to open a locked door—pushing harder on a door that's locked won't help. You need the right key. In learning, that might mean asking for help, breaking things into smaller steps, or approaching the problem from a different angle. Does that make sense?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Can you think of a situation where you might need a different strategy rather than just more effort?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Exactly. Asking for help and seeking different explanations are both growth mindset strategies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "I'd also love to hear from someone who hasn't spoken much yet. Member4—what's one area where you'd like to grow or improve?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Thank you for that honest reflection. That takes courage to admit. What do you think makes you give up?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That frustration is completely normal. Everyone feels that way sometimes. Growth mindset doesn't mean we never feel frustrated—it means we recognize that feeling and choose to keep going anyway. What's something small you could try when you feel that frustration coming?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's a really smart strategy. Taking a break can help your brain process information. You're showing growth mindset by thinking about how to handle that challenge."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Let me share something interesting about the brain. When you make mistakes and keep trying, your brain is actually creating new neural pathways. It's literally growing stronger. That's why effort matters more than talent—because effort is what builds your brain's capacity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "I hear you. What makes you say you're terrible at art?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's the growth mindset shift right there. You moved from 'I'm terrible' to 'I haven't learned yet.' That's powerful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Sometimes when we fail, we feel embarrassed or ashamed. Those feelings are valid and normal. Growth mindset doesn't mean we ignore feelings. It means we acknowledge them and then ask ourselves: 'What can I learn from this?' Has anyone experienced that shift before?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That persistence really paid off. What kept you going even when it was difficult?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "So you had a goal, and you were willing to try a new strategy by studying with your friend. Those are both growth mindset actions. Thank you for sharing that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Let's do a quick activity. I want everyone to think silently for a moment about one challenge you're currently facing—it could be academic, social, or personal. Just hold that in your mind."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Now, what would a fixed mindset thought about that challenge sound like?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Good examples. Notice how those thoughts close the door on possibility. Now, how could we reframe each of those with a growth mindset?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Now let's make this practical. What is one small action you could take this week toward your challenge? It doesn't have to be big—small steps count."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's specific and realistic. Consistency with small amounts often works better than sporadic large efforts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's such an important growth mindset skill—recognizing when you need help and being willing to ask for it. That's not weakness; that's strategic learning."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's okay. What's the challenge you were thinking about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Thank you for sharing. What's one small thing that might help with that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's a perfect first step. You're taking control instead of feeling helpless. That's growth mindset in action."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "I want to emphasize something important: growth mindset isn't about being perfect or never struggling. It's about how we respond to struggle. It's about believing that effort, strategies, and persistence lead to improvement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Another great question. Failure still happens, even with growth mindset. But there's a difference between failing and being a failure. Failing is an event—it's something that happened. It's not who you are. And each time we fail, we have information about what to try differently next time. Does that distinction make sense?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Let's reflect for a moment. I'd like to hear from each of you: what's one thing from today's discussion that stood out to you or that you want to remember?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's powerful. Thank you for sharing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Perfect. The challenge is where the growth happens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Before we close, let me summarize the key ideas. Growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. Your brain is like a muscle that gets stronger with use. Effort matters more than talent. Failure is information that helps us learn, not a reflection of our worth. And we can always add the word 'yet' to our challenges."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "This week, I'd like you to notice your self-talk. When you catch yourself thinking something like 'I can't do this' or 'I'm not good at that,' pause. Add the word 'yet,' and then take one small action toward improvement. Next session, we'll talk about how it went."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "I'm really glad to hear that. That's exactly what growth mindset is about—recognizing that you have agency and that small steps lead to real change."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "I appreciate you all being so engaged and willing to share today. You all demonstrated growth mindset just by being open to these ideas and reflecting honestly on your challenges."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Remember: you're not stuck where you are. Your abilities can grow. Your effort matters. And every challenge is an opportunity to learn."
