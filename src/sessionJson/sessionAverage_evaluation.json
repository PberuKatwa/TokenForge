  "reasoning": "The session demonstrated strong content coverage, clearly articulating the core tenets of growth mindset, including the brain-as-muscle metaphor and the emphasis on effort over talent, reinforcing these concepts multiple times. Protocol safety was exemplary; the Fellow appropriately disclaimed medical advice regarding anxiety medication and correctly referred the member to a medical professional, while providing safe, general wellness suggestions. Facilitation quality was moderate; while some validation was present and one effective open-ended question was posed ('Have you tried talking to them about how you feel?'), the overall facilitation tended to be more didactic, often asking for confirmation of understanding rather than fostering deeper exploration or encouraging extensive participant dialogue. There were also instances of the Fellow quickly moving on or redirecting discussions back to the curriculum."
