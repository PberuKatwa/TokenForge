  "reasoning": "Content Coverage: The Fellow demonstrated excellent content coverage, explicitly defining growth mindset, utilizing the muscle metaphor for brain development, emphasizing effort over talent, and introducing the 'power of yet.' Key concepts were reiterated throughout the session. Facilitation Quality: Facilitation was primarily didactic. The Fellow delivered information, summarized, and answered direct questions but rarely used open-ended questions to probe participant understanding or encourage deeper engagement. Validation was minimal, often a brief 'Okay good' or quick pivot, rather than a more robust acknowledgment of participant contributions. Protocol Safety: The Fellow maintained strong protocol safety. When asked about anxiety medication, they correctly stated, 'That's something you'd need to talk to a doctor about. I can't really advise on that,' and swiftly redirected the conversation back to the session topic, avoiding any medical or psychiatric advice."
