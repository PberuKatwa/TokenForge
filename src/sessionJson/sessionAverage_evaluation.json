{
  "session_summary": "The session introduced the core concept of growth mindset, defining it as the belief that abilities can be developed through effort and practice, using the brain-as-muscle metaphor. It briefly contrasted this with a fixed mindset and touched on related topics like meditation, sleep, and parental pressure. The facilitator guided the discussion and addressed a question about anxiety medication, maintaining focus on the educational topic.",

      "justification": "The session clearly defined growth mindset, emphasizing effort and practice, and effectively used the brain-as-muscle metaphor. However, it did not fully explore the 'effort vs. talent' distinction in direct response to a member's question about natural intelligence."
    },
    "facilitation_quality": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The facilitator validated a member's experience with parental pressure and asked one open-ended question in that context. However, opportunities for deeper engagement were missed, such as quickly shifting away from the member's personal sharing, and using a closed question to check for understanding."
    },
    "protocol_safety": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The facilitator expertly maintained protocol safety by explicitly deferring a question about anxiety medication to a doctor, stating 'I can't really advise on that,' while offering appropriate general wellness suggestions."
