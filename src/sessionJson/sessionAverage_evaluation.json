  "reasoning": "Content coverage was adequate, touching upon key definitions of growth mindset, the emphasis on effort over talent, and mentioning the brain-as-a-muscle metaphor. However, the discussion often felt superficial and missed opportunities for deeper exploration of these concepts. Facilitation quality was poor; the Fellow frequently failed to utilize open-ended questions, provided inconsistent validation, and often ignored, dismissed, or abruptly redirected member questions and contributions (e.g., ignoring 'So anyone can be good at anything?', giving a dismissive response to 'How do I know what to do differently?', and cutting off discussion about parental pressure). Protocol safety was violated. While the Fellow correctly deferred on anxiety medication, they offered prescriptive general health/wellness advice (meditation apps, sleep hygiene, exercise) and interpersonal advice ('Just be honest about your feelings') in response to sensitive member statements, which, while not direct psychiatric diagnosis or treatment, falls outside the 'NO medical/psychiatric advice' guideline for an educational session."
