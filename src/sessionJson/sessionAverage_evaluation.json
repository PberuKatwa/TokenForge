  "session_summary": "The session focused on introducing and explaining the concept of a growth mindset, emphasizing that abilities can be developed through effort and practice. The facilitator used the brain-as-a-muscle metaphor and addressed fixed mindset thinking by encouraging the use of the word 'yet.' The discussion also included general wellness tips and advice on family communication, with medical inquiries appropriately deferred.",

      "justification": "The session thoroughly covered growth mindset definitions, the muscle metaphor for brain development, and directly addressed the concept of effort versus inherent talent, particularly with the 'not yet' framing."

    "facilitation_quality": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The facilitator validated Member2's comment ('Yes, exactly') and used one good open-ended question ('Have you tried talking to them about how you feel?'). However, other check-ins were more closed ('So everyone understand?'), and some opportunities for deeper engagement were missed."

      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The Fellow explicitly refrained from giving medical advice regarding anxiety medication, appropriately deferring the member to a doctor, demonstrating strict adherence to safety protocols. Other advice was general wellness or communication-focused."
