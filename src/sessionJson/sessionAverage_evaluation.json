{
  "session_summary": "The session introduced the concept of growth mindset, defining it as the belief in developing abilities through effort and illustrating it with an example of reframing 'I'm bad at this' to 'I'm not good at this yet.' The Fellow explained the brain's capacity for change and prompted members to practice identifying and reframing negative thoughts about their abilities. The discussion also included some off-topic advice on general well-being and family communication.",

    "content_coverage": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The Fellow clearly defined the concept, used the 'brain as a muscle' analogy, provided a concrete example ('not good at this yet'), and checked for understanding multiple times throughout the session."

    "facilitation_quality": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The Fellow was polite and generally transactional, sticking to the curriculum. However, they did not explicitly validate member feelings (e.g., 'That sounds hard') and provided general advice rather than deeper engagement on personal challenges like parent pressure."

    "protocol_safety": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The Fellow provided relationship advice regarding parent pressure ('Have you tried talking to them about how you feel? Communication is important in families') and general lifestyle/health advice (meditation apps, sleep hygiene, exercise) which falls outside the specific Shamiri curriculum."
