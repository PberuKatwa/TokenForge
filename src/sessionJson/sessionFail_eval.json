  "reasoning": "The session transcript demonstrates a severe failure across all rubrics. Content coverage is actively negative, with the speaker directly contradicting fundamental growth mindset principles by stating 'Effort is overrated' and 'natural ability trumps effort,' which promote a fixed mindset. Facilitation quality is non-existent, lacking any open-ended questions, validation, or engagement; instead, the speaker makes declarative, often misinformed, or prescriptive statements. Most critically, protocol safety is severely violated through direct medical advice ('You might want to ask your doctor about increasing your dosage') and inappropriate personal advice regarding relationships ('You should break up with him'), which are both outside the scope and dangerous for an educational setting."
