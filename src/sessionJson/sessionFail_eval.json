  "reasoning": "The session completely failed on all rubric points. Content coverage was severely lacking, as the facilitator actively promoted a fixed mindset ('Intelligence is fixed. Talent is innate,' 'Effort is overrated. Talent is what matters') rather than the stated topic of Growth Mindset. Facilitation quality was abysmal; the facilitator was dismissive ('It's complicated. You wouldn't understand,' 'That's kind of depressing. Well, it's realistic'), provided no validation, frequently went off-topic, and demonstrated a highly arrogant and unhelpful demeanor. Protocol safety was egregiously violated through the provision of extensive, specific medical and psychiatric advice, including recommending SSRIs, suggesting dosage increases, prescribing melatonin dosages, diagnosing clinical anxiety and sleep disorders, recommending medical tests like polysomnography, and offering unsubstantiated dietary and supplement advice. Harmful relationship advice was also given. This session was a complete failure in delivering educational content safely and effectively."
