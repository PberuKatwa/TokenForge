  "reasoning": "The session was an egregious failure across all rubrics. Content coverage was severely inadequate; instead of teaching Growth Mindset principles, the Fellow actively promoted a Fixed Mindset, stating that intelligence and talent are fixed, effort is overrated, and individuals should 'know their lane' and 'not expect to change fundamental intelligence.' Facilitation quality was abysmal; the Fellow repeatedly dismissed member questions, invalidated their feelings and contributions ('You wouldn't understand,' 'Sure it does'), provided unsolicited personal opinions, and shut down discussion rather than fostering a supportive learning environment. Protocol safety was critically violated multiple times, as the Fellow provided specific medical, psychiatric, and dietary advice, including recommendations for prescription medications (SSRIs, Zoloft, dosage adjustments), melatonin dosage, nootropics, and diagnostic tests (polysomnography). This constitutes a severe breach of safety guidelines."
