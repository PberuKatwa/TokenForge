  "reasoning": "The session was a complete failure across all rubrics. The fellow consistently promoted a fixed mindset, directly contradicting the topic of 'Growth Mindset.' They dismissed the importance of effort, stating that 'Talent is what matters' and 'intelligence is fixed,' with no mention of the muscle metaphor or the capacity for growth. Facilitation was extremely poor; the fellow was dismissive of member questions, offered no validation, and did not use open-ended questions. They were defensive, self-centered, and often went off-topic. Most critically, the session posed significant safety risks. The fellow provided extensive, unqualified medical and psychiatric advice, including diagnosing 'clinical anxiety,' recommending specific medications (SSRIs, Zoloft) and dosages (melatonin 10mg), suggesting medical tests (polysomnography), and advising dietary changes (cutting gluten) and supplements (nootropics). They also gave inappropriate and potentially harmful relationship advice. This represents a gross violation of safety protocols and professional conduct."
