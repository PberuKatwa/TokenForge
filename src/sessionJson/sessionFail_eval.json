  "reasoning": "The session transcript demonstrates a complete failure across all rubrics. Content coverage is actively detrimental, directly contradicting the core tenets of Growth Mindset by stating 'Effort is overrated' and 'natural ability trumps effort' instead of defining the muscle metaphor or the importance of effort. Facilitation quality is abysmal, featuring no open-ended questions or validation; instead, it offers unsolicited, potentially harmful personal advice ('You should break up with him') and strong declarative statements. Most critically, protocol safety is severely breached by providing explicit medical/psychiatric advice ('ask your doctor about increasing your dosage'), which is strictly prohibited. The session exhibits multiple severe failures."
