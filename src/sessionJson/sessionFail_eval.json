  "reasoning": "The session was a complete failure across all audited rubrics. The Fellow explicitly provided medical and psychiatric advice, including diagnosing 'clinical anxiety,' recommending specific medication (SSRIs/Zoloft), and even suggesting dosage adjustments, which is a severe and unacceptable breach of safety protocol. Content coverage for 'Growth Mindset' was not only absent but actively detrimental, as the Fellow promoted a Fixed Mindset ('Effort is overrated. Talent is what matters,' 'don't expect to change your fundamental intelligence level') directly contradicting the session's stated topic. Facilitation quality was extremely poor, characterized by a complete lack of open-ended questions, no validation of participants, off-topic personal opinions (e.g., 'teenage relationships are toxic,' 'establish dominance'), and dismissive behavior ('Anyway, we're running out of time. Class dismissed'). The Fellow also offered harmful relationship advice. This session demonstrated a significant lack of competence and adherence to educational best practices and safety guidelines."
