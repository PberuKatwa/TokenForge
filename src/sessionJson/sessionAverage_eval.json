  "reasoning": "The session effectively covered the core concepts of growth mindset, including its definition, the 'brain as a muscle' metaphor, and the emphasis on effort over talent. Key examples like using the word 'yet' and reframing negative thoughts were also provided, demonstrating strong content coverage. However, the facilitation quality was low. The fellow rarely used open-ended questions to encourage deeper reflection or discussion, primarily relying on closed questions like 'So everyone understand?'. While there were instances of validation for member experiences, these were often brief and quickly followed by a redirection back to the curriculum or general advice, rather than exploring the member's perspective further. On the other hand, protocol safety was excellent. The fellow appropriately declined to offer advice on anxiety medication, correctly referring the member to a doctor, and kept all other advice within general wellness guidelines, such as exercise and sleep hygiene."
