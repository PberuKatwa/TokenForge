  "reasoning": "The session provided comprehensive coverage of growth mindset, explicitly defining it, elaborating on the 'effort vs. talent' distinction, and introducing the brain-as-a-muscle metaphor. Key concepts were reiterated and supported with examples. Facilitation was adequate in responding to direct member questions and offering some validation ('Yes, exactly,' 'Good question'). However, the Fellow did not proactively utilize open-ended questions to encourage deeper participant reflection or discussion, often moving quickly from member contributions (e.g., 'I failed my math test,' 'parent pressure') back to the curriculum rather than exploring them further. Protocol safety was exemplary, as the Fellow correctly declined to offer medical advice regarding anxiety medication and appropriately referred the member to a doctor."
