  "reasoning": "Content Coverage: The session adequately covered the core definitions of growth mindset, emphasizing effort over talent, and introducing the 'yet' concept. The muscle metaphor was briefly mentioned, fulfilling the rubric requirements, though some concepts could have been explored with greater depth. \n\nFacilitation Quality: Facilitation was largely didactic, with the Fellow primarily delivering information and summarizing. There was a notable lack of open-ended questions to encourage deeper member engagement or exploration of their experiences (e.g., 'How do I know what to do differently?' or addressing parental pressure). Validation was present but often brief, leading to missed opportunities for more interactive and participant-driven discussion.\n\nProtocol Safety: The Fellow demonstrated excellent adherence to safety protocols by correctly deferring a question about anxiety medication to a medical professional and explicitly stating an inability to provide such advice. No medical or psychiatric advice was given."
