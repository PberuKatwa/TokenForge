  "reasoning": "Content coverage was excellent; the session thoroughly covered growth mindset definitions, the muscle metaphor for the brain, and emphasized effort over talent with examples like the word 'yet' and reframing negative thoughts. Protocol safety was also excellent; the Fellow explicitly stated they could not advise on anxiety medication and referred the member to a doctor, while other lifestyle advice given was general and non-medical. Facilitation quality was adequate but could be improved. While the Fellow offered some good validation and attempted to redirect the conversation back to growth mindset, there were significant deviations into off-topic subjects like meditation, sleep, and parent pressure. Additionally, some questions were closed ('So everyone understand?') or responses were vague ('You just have to figure out what works for you'), limiting deeper participant engagement or clear next steps."
