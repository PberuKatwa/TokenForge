  "reasoning": "The session exhibited exceptional quality across all rubrics. Content coverage was comprehensive, clearly defining growth mindset, effectively utilizing the brain-as-a-muscle metaphor, and consistently highlighting the importance of effort over inherent talent with relevant examples. Facilitation quality was outstanding; the Fellow masterfully employed open-ended questions to foster deep engagement and reflection from all participants, and consistently validated their contributions and feelings, creating a highly supportive environment. Protocol safety was perfectly maintained, as the discussion remained purely educational, providing cognitive reframing and practical strategies without venturing into any medical or psychiatric advice."
