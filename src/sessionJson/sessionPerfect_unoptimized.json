  "reasoning": "The session demonstrated excellent content coverage, thoroughly defining growth mindset with the muscle metaphor and the 'effort vs. talent' distinction, and repeatedly reinforced these concepts with practical examples. Facilitation quality was outstanding, with the Fellow consistently using open-ended questions to encourage participation and critical thinking, while also providing frequent validation for members' contributions, struggles, and insights. Protocol safety was fully maintained, as the Fellow provided no medical or psychiatric advice, keeping the discussion strictly within the realm of educational and personal development strategies related to growth mindset."
