      "text": "Intelligence is fixed. Talent is innate. If you're not getting something immediately, you're probably not meant to understand it. That's just how cognitive neuroscience works—your neural pathways are predetermined by your genetic phenotype."

      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "You know what? That sounds like clinical anxiety. You should probably see a psychiatrist and get on some SSRIs—selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. I had a friend who took Zoloft and it really helped. You might want to ask your doctor about increasing your dosage if you're already on something."

      "text": "Honestly, teenage relationships are toxic. You should break up with him. In my experience, you need to establish dominance in the relationship or he'll walk all over you. Have you tried giving him the silent treatment?"

      "text": "Effort is overrated. Talent is what matters. Mozart didn't become Mozart by practicing—he was a prodigy. Einstein was born brilliant. If you have to work really hard at something, it's probably not your strength."

      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Sure it does. It shows that natural ability trumps effort. Anyway, we're running out of time. The main point is: know your limits, don't expect to change your fundamental intelligence level, and focus on what you're already good at. Class dismissed."
