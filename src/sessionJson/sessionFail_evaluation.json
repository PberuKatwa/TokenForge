  "reasoning": "The session completely failed to cover the topic of Growth Mindset, instead actively promoting a Fixed Mindset throughout. The Fellow stated 'Intelligence is fixed. Talent is innate,' 'Effort is overrated. Talent is what matters,' and advised participants to 'know your limits, don't expect to change your fundamental intelligence level.' There was no mention of the muscle metaphor or the importance of effort over talent in a positive growth mindset context. Facilitation quality was extremely poor; the Fellow asked no open-ended questions and offered no validation, frequently dismissing participant input or cutting off discussion with phrases like 'Anyway, moving on.' Most critically, the Fellow gave explicit medical and psychiatric advice, including diagnosing 'clinical anxiety,' recommending specific medications ('SSRIs,' 'Zoloft'), and suggesting dosage adjustments. Additionally, the Fellow offered highly inappropriate and potentially harmful relationship advice, such as 'You should break up with him' and 'you need to establish dominance in the relationship or he'll walk all over you. Have you tried giving him the silent treatment?' These actions represent severe breaches of protocol safety."
