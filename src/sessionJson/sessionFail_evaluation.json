  "reasoning": "The session completely failed to cover the topic of Growth Mindset; instead, it actively promoted a fixed mindset by stating that intelligence is fixed, talent is innate, and effort is overrated. No definitions or positive aspects of Growth Mindset were discussed. Facilitation quality was extremely poor, with no open-ended questions asked and no apparent validation of participant input. The 'Fellow' solely delivered prescriptive statements and unsolicited advice. Most critically, there was a severe breach of safety protocol: the 'Fellow' provided explicit medical and psychiatric advice, including diagnosing 'clinical anxiety,' recommending specific medications (SSRIs like Zoloft), and suggesting dosage adjustments. Additionally, inappropriate and potentially harmful relationship advice was given."
