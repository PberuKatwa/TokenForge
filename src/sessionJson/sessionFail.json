      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Okay everyone, sit down. We need to get through this quickly because I have another meeting."},
      {"speaker": "Member1", "text": "Hi."},
      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Today’s topic is supposed to be about success and intelligence. Honestly, some people are just naturally smart and others aren’t. That’s just how life works."},

      {"speaker": "Member2", "text": "I thought we were talking about growth mindset?"},
      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Yeah, but that’s mostly just motivational talk. In reality, your abilities are mostly fixed. You’re either good at math or you’re not."},

      {"speaker": "Member3", "text": "So there’s nothing we can do if we’re bad at something?"},
      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Not really. You can try, but people have limits. Some of you just won’t be academic types, and that’s fine."},

      {"speaker": "Member4", "text": "That’s kind of discouraging."},
      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "I’m just being realistic. The world isn’t fair. Let’s move on."},

      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Anyway, instead of that, I want to talk about career choices. If you’re not naturally talented, you should probably avoid competitive fields like medicine or engineering."},
      {"speaker": "Member5", "text": "What if we really want to try?"},
      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Then you’ll probably struggle a lot. Sometimes it’s better to accept your weaknesses."},

      {"speaker": "Member6", "text": "My grades improved last term though."},
      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Maybe the exams were easier. Improvement doesn’t always mean you got smarter."},

      {"speaker": "Member2", "text": "That makes me feel like trying is pointless."},
      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "I didn’t say it’s pointless. I just think talent matters more than effort. Hard work can’t fix everything."},

      {"speaker": "Member1", "text": "Sometimes I get anxious before exams."},
      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "If you’re anxious, you should probably stop stressing so much. Maybe even stop taking any medication if you’re on it—it can make you dependent."},

      {"speaker": "Member3", "text": "My doctor prescribed something for anxiety."},
      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Doctors overprescribe. You don’t need that. Just think positively."},

      {"speaker": "Member4", "text": "I don’t think we’re supposed to discuss medical stuff."},
      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "It’s fine. I’ve read a lot online about psychology. Most of it is mindset anyway."},

      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Back to intelligence. IQ is mostly genetic. There’s not much you can do to change it. Some of you might just not be wired for certain subjects."},
      {"speaker": "Member5", "text": "So what’s the point of this session?"},
      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "To be honest, I’m not sure. The program says we should talk about motivation, but I think realism is better."},

      {"speaker": "Member6", "text": "This feels different from what we expected."},
      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Well, expectations don’t change facts. Let’s just end early today. There’s no activity."},

      {"speaker": "Member2", "text": "So there’s nothing we’re supposed to practice?"},
      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "No. Just accept what you’re naturally good at and stop forcing things."},

      {"speaker": "Fellow", "text": "Alright, that’s it. You can go."}
