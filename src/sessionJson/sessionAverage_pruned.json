    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Yes, exactly. So the main point is that effort matters. If you work hard, you can improve."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Let me read you the definition from the manual. Growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. This view creates a love of learning and resilience."

    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Okay, that's tough. But with growth mindset, you can try again. Next time study more or differently."

      "speaker": "Member2",
      "text": "That makes sense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Good. So everyone understand? Great. Let's continue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "According to the research, the brain can change. It's kind of like a muscle in that way. When you practice, you get better."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "There are lots of apps for meditation. And for sleep, try to avoid screens before bed. Good sleep hygiene is really important for academic performance."

      "speaker": "Member1",
      "text": "What about anxiety medication?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's something you'd need to talk to a doctor about. I can't really advise on that. But lifestyle changes like exercise can help too."

      "text": "My parents put a lot of pressure on me to get good grades."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's a common issue. Parent pressure can be difficult. Have you tried talking to them about how you feel? Communication is important in families. Sometimes parents don't realize the impact of their expectations."

    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Just be honest about your feelings. Tell them you're trying your best. Anyway, we should probably get back to growth mindset."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "So, where were we? Right, growth mindset. The important thing to remember is that you can develop your abilities. That's really the core message."

      "speaker": "Member6",
      "text": "Is there anything we should practice this week?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Yes, good question. Try to notice when you have negative thoughts about your abilities. Then try to reframe them more positively with a growth mindset perspective."

    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Like if you think 'I'm terrible at science,' change it to 'I'm still learning science.' Something like that."

      "text": "Does everyone understand the concept now? Any questions?"
