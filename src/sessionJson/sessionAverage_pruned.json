    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Let me read you the definition from the manual. Growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. This view creates a love of learning and resilience."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Member3",
      "text": "But some people are just naturally smarter, right?"
    },

      "text": "[6 turn(s) omitted]"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "So, to summarize: growth mindset means you can improve. Fixed mindset means you think you can't. You should have a growth mindset."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Member5",
      "text": "Can you give us an example?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Sure. Like, if you're bad at something, instead of saying 'I'm bad at this,' you say 'I'm not good at this yet.' The word 'yet' is important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Member2",
      "text": "That makes sense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Good. So everyone understand? Great. Let's continue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "According to the research, the brain can change. It's kind of like a muscle in that way. When you practice, you get better."

      "text": "Do you have any specific techniques?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "There are lots of apps for meditation. And for sleep, try to avoid screens before bed. Good sleep hygiene is really important for academic performance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Member1",
      "text": "What about anxiety medication?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's something you'd need to talk to a doctor about. I can't really advise on that. But lifestyle changes like exercise can help too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Member5",
      "text": "My parents put a lot of pressure on me to get good grades."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's a common issue. Parent pressure can be difficult. Have you tried talking to them about how you feel? Communication is important in families. Sometimes parents don't realize the impact of their expectations."

      "text": "Is there anything we should practice this week?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Yes, good question. Try to notice when you have negative thoughts about your abilities. Then try to reframe them more positively with a growth mindset perspective."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Member3",
      "text": "Like what?"
    },

      "text": "Does everyone understand the concept now? Any questions?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Member4",
      "text": "I think I get it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Member1",
      "text": "Yeah, makes sense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Okay good. So the main points are: effort matters, you can improve through practice, and don't have a fixed mindset. Those are the key takeaways."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Let me check my notes... yes, I think we've covered everything. Growth mindset is about believing you can develop your abilities. That's what you need to remember."
