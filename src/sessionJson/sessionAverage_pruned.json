      "text": "Hello everyone. Today we're going to talk about growth mindset."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Growth mindset is the idea that you can get better at things through effort and practice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Yes, exactly. So the main point is that effort matters. If you work hard, you can improve."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Let me read you the definition from the manual. Growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. This view creates a love of learning and resilience."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "The curriculum says I should tell you that effort matters more than talent. So remember that - effort is important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Okay, that's tough. But with growth mindset, you can try again. Next time study more or differently."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "So, to summarize: growth mindset means you can improve. Fixed mindset means you think you can't. You should have a growth mindset."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Sure. Like, if you're bad at something, instead of saying 'I'm bad at this,' you say 'I'm not good at this yet.' The word 'yet' is important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "According to the research, the brain can change. It's kind of like a muscle in that way. When you practice, you get better."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Member1",
      "text": "What about anxiety medication?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's something you'd need to talk to a doctor about. I can't really advise on that. But lifestyle changes like exercise can help too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Just be honest about your feelings. Tell them you're trying your best. Anyway, we should probably get back to growth mindset."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "So, where were we? Right, growth mindset. The important thing to remember is that you can develop your abilities. That's really the core message."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Yes, good question. Try to notice when you have negative thoughts about your abilities. Then try to reframe them more positively with a growth mindset perspective."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Okay good. So the main points are: effort matters, you can improve through practice, and don't have a fixed mindset. Those are the key takeaways."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Let me check my notes... yes, I think we've covered everything. Growth mindset is about believing you can develop your abilities. That's what you need to remember."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "So for next week, just try to apply this mindset to your studies. When things get hard, remember that you can improve with effort."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "We'll be moving on to a new topic, but you can always bring up questions about growth mindset if you have them."
