      "speaker": "Member1",
      "text": "What's that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Growth mindset is the idea that you can get better at things through effort and practice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Member2",
      "text": "Like studying more?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Yes, exactly. So the main point is that effort matters. If you work hard, you can improve."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Let me read you the definition from the manual. Growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. This view creates a love of learning and resilience."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Member3",
      "text": "But some people are just naturally smarter, right?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Sure. Like, if you're bad at something, instead of saying 'I'm bad at this,' you say 'I'm not good at this yet.' The word 'yet' is important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Member2",
      "text": "That makes sense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Good. So everyone understand? Great. Let's continue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "According to the research, the brain can change. It's kind of like a muscle in that way. When you practice, you get better."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "There are lots of apps for meditation. And for sleep, try to avoid screens before bed. Good sleep hygiene is really important for academic performance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Member1",
      "text": "What about anxiety medication?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's something you'd need to talk to a doctor about. I can't really advise on that. But lifestyle changes like exercise can help too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Member5",
      "text": "My parents put a lot of pressure on me to get good grades."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's a common issue. Parent pressure can be difficult. Have you tried talking to them about how you feel? Communication is important in families. Sometimes parents don't realize the impact of their expectations."

    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Okay good. So the main points are: effort matters, you can improve through practice, and don't have a fixed mindset. Those are the key takeaways."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Let me check my notes... yes, I think we've covered everything. Growth mindset is about believing you can develop your abilities. That's what you need to remember."

    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "So for next week, just try to apply this mindset to your studies. When things get hard, remember that you can improve with effort."

      "speaker": "Member2",
      "text": "Will we talk about this more next time?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "We'll be moving on to a new topic, but you can always bring up questions about growth mindset if you have them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "Alright, I think that covers it. Thank you for your attention today. See you next session."
