      "text": "Sure. Like, if you're bad at something, instead of saying 'I'm bad at this,' you say 'I'm not good at this yet.' The word 'yet' is important."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fellow",
      "text": "That's something you'd need to talk to a doctor about. I can't really advise on that. But lifestyle changes like exercise can help too."
